# littlelisp
initially a 'secret' component of my personal website, I made it its own repo for management purposes.
NOTE: This iteration does not work locally with chrome set to default settings. You need to allow Cross origin requests.

to run: clone and run index.html in firefox or chrome with cross origin requests enabled. Heroku to come.
