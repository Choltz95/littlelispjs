# littlelisp
An implementation of classical lisp in approx. 100 lines of javascript. Inspired by the implementations of John McCarthy, Peter Norvig, and Marry Cook.

Initially an easter egg in my personal website, I made this project its own repo for management purposes.
NOTE: This iteration does not work locally with chrome set to default settings - you need set up a local webserver to allow Cross origin requests or you can simply open index.html in firefox.

to run: clone and run index.html in firefox or chrome with cross origin requests enabled. An older version is deployed to http://littlelispjs.divshot.io/
