# littlelisp
An implementation of classical lisp in approx. 100 lines of javascript. Inspired by the implementations of John McCarthy, Peter Norvig, and Marry Cook.

initially a 'secret' component of my personal website, I made it its own repo for management purposes.
NOTE: This iteration does not work locally with chrome set to default settings. You need to allow Cross origin requests.

to run: clone and run index.html in firefox or chrome with cross origin requests enabled. An older version is deployed to http://littlelispjs.divshot.io/
